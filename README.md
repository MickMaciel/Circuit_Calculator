# Circuit_Calculator

My first program in C language.  This program implements a circuit calculator, allowing the calculation of resistance (Ohms), voltage (Volts), and current (mA) based on user inputs. 
The code includes a main menu with options to select the calculation mode (Ohms, Volts, or mA).
